# Notepad++-syntax is:

Some languages in Notepad++ defined by me.<br/>
Use them in your Notepad++ ! :smile: <br/>
Actually some of them are just some scripting files in some specific softwares, like devcpp, emacs, IntelliJ, etc.<br/>
But also some great languages like kotlin, and DSLs like gradle, markdown, etc.<br/>
Hope this will help you. :smile:

Contribution is always welcomed.<br/>
Just find what you want in the corresponding named files.

Actually while wrriting this file, I am using the `markdown`  language support, it is like this:<br/>

# How to use
Open your Notepad++, and select "Language" on the menu bar, and choose "Define your language".<br/>
Press the "Import" button, and select the configuration xml file in this project.<br/>
For instance, if you want to use markdown support, choose [md.xml](./DSLs/md.xml).<br/>
And restart Notepad++, then enjoy the special highlighting! :smile:
